Replication and extension of Blanchett (2007), Dynamic Allocation Strategies for Distribution Portfolios: Determining the Optimal Distribution Glide Path, published in the Journal of Financial Planning 20(12): 66-83.

Blanchett tests 43 equity glide paths (Constant, Linear, Stair, Convex, Concave) across 1,071 retirement scenarios using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario. He measures probability of failure and the Success to Variability (STV) ratio, which penalizes volatility. The main finding is that aggressive portfolios dominate on pure probability, but moderate allocations become far more efficient on a risk-adjusted basis. 

The paper assumes a fixed, known distribution period. This replication replaces it with a personalized mortality distribution from a Cox proportional hazards model fitted to MIDUS survey data (M02_mortality_model.Rmd). The personal mortality prediction (M03_my_mortality_prediction.Rmd) outputs a survival curve as mc_mortality_input.rds, which this file loads to sample 10,000 death ages per simulation. The glide paths now govern the full lifespan (accumulation through distribution), P(ruin) is mortality-weighted rather than fixed-horizon, and we add bequest analysis (P(bequest >= target) and median terminal wealth at death). The user fills in a questionnaire with their financial inputs and the simulation finds the optimal glide path subject to a maximum acceptable ruin probability.

The failure rates do not match the paper exactly because the paper bootstraps actual monthly returns while we draw from a parametric multivariate lognormal. The qualitative findings replicate and the quantitative results lead to the same conclusions as Blanchett.
